    <p>
      So this is my first website built <em>Entirely</em> in html code.
      I am just going to use this space to experiment and try stuff.
      I was banging my head against the wall trying to remember how to make
      a bulleted list. I ended up opening another project and copying the code</p>
    <p>
    <ol>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>CSS</li>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      These three topics I currently consider <bold><em>The Good Stuff</em></bold>
      and I really want to get after it. However I will patience!
      After a proper treatment of html, I will eventually get to them.

  <div class='heading' id="day2">

    <h3>[Teacher Skips Class]</h3>

  <div class="content">
    <p>
      so my math teacher called in sick today so I Kinda have the day off. I
      figured
      would take the opportunity to study some more. Today is a continuation of
      HTML.
      I will put more as we go. "back to the lab again yo!"
    </p>

  <div class='heading' id="day3">
    <h2>Day 3 </h2>

    <h3>[The Good Stuff!]</h3>

  <div class="content">
    <p>
      So today I finally passed through HTML review and got onto CSS.
      have been looking forward to learning about
      Cascading Style Sheets for a while. I used to simply ignore CSS, Java
      and the
      like.

      <caption>The Journey</caption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      I would look at the code and say to myself "I dont know what all that is".
      I am still not
      sure how exactly to setup a background image. I will have to wait until I
      get to that. I will keep
      the blog up to date.

        <bold>Merry Almost Christmas!
      </strong></bold>
      It's Christmas eve and I just got home from working
      The first thing I find myself doing is coding. Even though at this stage
      it's pretty exclusively "HTML" with a
      tiny bit of Python when I tinker with one of my 3 simple projects. I am
      trying to train my brain to
      become accustomed to this world. This line of thinking and seeing. I want
      my brain to
      become comfortable with these patterns so that I can learn as efficiently
      and thoroughly
      as possible.

  <div class='heading' id="day5">

    <p>
      So this is Christmas. It is nice to be back to "Normal" after 3 years
      of Covid Hell. I find myself alone in the basement at 4:10 am. I am
      actually surprised none of the kids have woken up yet to get it started.
      Today is a continuation of CSS. I am going to get as much work done
      before
      the kids wake up early for the routine.

  <div class='heading' id="day6">
    <h2>Day 6</h2>

    <h3>[Boxing Day]</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      It is 1:46 am on boxing day as I come to the end of the CSS module.
      I took a detour and played around with Git and GitHub.
      I also played around with MS Code to configure it
      more to my liking. I will probably add more to today's entry later on.
      I just wanted to add another day since I officially can. Yeah it's
      my own silly rule.

    Today is a day that I made the mistake of pondering the road in its
    <a href="https://bootcamp.ce.arizona.edu/blog/front-end-developer-skills/">gruesome entirety</a>. The questions
    started to crop up
    in my mind that I have dealt with time and time again in the past.
    I am very glad I read <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Cant-Hurt-Me-Master-Your/dp/1544512287" target="_blank">"You
      Cant Hurt Me": by David Goggins</a>
    I decided to go to youtube and watch one of his videos. He helps me inspire Me.
    as his catch phrase <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JV8mIfjwPeM&t=173s" target="_blank">"Stay Hard"</a>
    reinforces, one must callous the mind to hardship. He posits that that most of us are putting out about 40% of our
    efforts at any given time.
    In the past I lacked perspective and a full understanding of the power of time and perseverance. I will revisit this
    list in a later post and describe how i feel about it at that time.

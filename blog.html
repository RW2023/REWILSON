        So this is my first website built <em>Entirely</em> in html code.
        I am just going to use this space to experiment and try stuff.
        I was banging my head against the wall trying to rember how to make
        a bulleted list. I ended up opening another project and copying the code
        <ol class="content">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      These three topics I currently consider <bold><em>The Good Stuff</em></bold>
      and I really want to get after it. However I will patience!
      After a proper treatment of html, I will eventually get to them.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class='heading'id="day2">
    <h1>Day 2</h1>
    <h2>December 23, 2022</h2>
    <h2>[Teacher Skips Class]</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      so my math teacheer called in sick today so I Kinda have the day off. I
      figured
      would take the oppertunity to study some more. Today is a continuation of
      HTML.
      I will put more as we go. "back to the lab again yo!"
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class='heading' id="day3">
    <h1>Day 3 </h1>
    <h2>December 23, 2022</h2>
    <h2>[The Good Stuff!]</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
        So today I finally passed through HTML review and got onto CSS.
        have been looking forward to learning about
        Cascading Style Sheets for a while. I used to simply ignore CSS, Java
        and the
        like.
        <figure>
          <img src="https://i.ibb.co/mHbGZ0F/PA210613.jpg" alt="a road in the evening sun"
            max-width="442px">
          <caption>The Journey</caption>
        </figure>
      I would look at the code and say to myself "I dont know what all that is".
      I am still not
      sure how exactly to setup a background image. I will have to wait until I
      get to that. I will keep
      the blog up to date.
    </p>
  </div>
  <!--I figure I can break it down by day and kind chronicle the learning-->
  <div class='heading' id="day4">
    <h1>Day 4</h1>
    <h2>December 24, 2022</h2>
    <h2>[Merry Christmas...Eve!]</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      <strong><bold>Merry Almost Christmas!</strong></bold>
      It's Christmas eve and I just got home from working
      The first thing I find myself doing is coding. Even though at this stage
      it's pretty exclusively "HTML" with a
      tiny bit of Python when I tinker with one of my 3 simple projects. I am
      trying to train my brain to
      become accustomed to this world. This line of thinking and seeing. I want
      my brain to
      become comfortable with these patterns so that I can learn as efficiently
      and thoroughly
      as possible.
    </p>
    <div class='heading'id="day5">
      <h1>Day 5</h1>
      <h2>December 25, 2022</h2>
      <h2>[Merry Christmas!]</h2>

    <div class="content">
      <p>
        So this is Christmas. It is nice to be back to "Normal" after 3 years
        of Covid Hell. I find myself alone in the basement at 4:10 am. I am
        actuall surprised none of the kids have woken up yet to get it started.
        Today is a continuation of CSS. I am going to get as much work done
        before
        the kids wake up early for the routine.
      </p>
      <div class='heading'id="day6">
        <h1>Day 6</h1>
        <h2>December 26, 2022</h2>
        <h2>[Boxing Day]</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          It is 1:46 am on boxing day as I come to the end of the CSS module.
          I took a detour and played around with Git and GitHub.
          I also played around with MS Code to configure it
          more to my liking. I will probably add more to today's entry later on.
          I just wanted to add another day since I officially can. Yeah it's
          my own silly rule.
        </p>
        <div class='heading'id="day7">

            Today is a day that I made the mistake of pondering the road in its
            gruosome entirety. The questions started to crop up
            in my mind that I have dealth with time and time again in the past.
            I am
            very glad I read <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Cant-Hurt-Me-Master-Your/dp/1544512287"
              target="_blank"</a>"You Cant Hurt Me": by David Goggins</a> 
            I decided to go to youtube and watch one of his videos. He helps me inspire Me.

    <div class="content">
      <p>
        üéâü•≥üéÜHappy New Year! So much has happened in the 5 days since I posted. I wanted to post everyday.
        however I cam to the realization that life will get in the way sometimes. To catch decided to get a few things 
        done. First up was version control. I did not like the method I was using before properly configuring <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>
        My method of repeatedly hitting CTRl-Z (undo), was not working for me. I decided to make my initial catetrophic errors
        and make silly mistakes on the front end rather than later. Up until this entry the site lived on my laptop. I am not struggling with CSS as I was 
        at the beggining (Like this is far lol).I am continuing to apply the things I learn
        and update the site as I go.

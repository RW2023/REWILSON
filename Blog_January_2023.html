      ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ†Happy New Year! So much has happened in the 5 days since I posted. I wanted to post everyday.
      however I cam to the realization that life will get in the way sometimes. To catch decided to get a few things
      done. First up was version control. I did not like the method I was using before properly configuring <a
        href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>
      My method of repeatedly hitting CTRl-Z (undo), was not working for me. I decided to make my initial catetrophic
      errors
      and make silly mistakes on the front end rather than later. Up until this entry the site lived on my laptop. I am
      not struggling with CSS as I was
      at the begging (Like this is far lol).I am continuing to apply the things I learn
      and update the site as I go.

    <p> I am super tired. However I wanted to post somethings as I haven't for a while.
      I have been able to make a few changes to the site with the skills I am learning.
      having the version control system working properly is a huge burden off my mind. What i find curious is how deep
      in the material it is introduced. Dn days where I am too
      beat to go on I will post a picture from my collection. I will strive to post more often.</p>

      The fight theme from the original Startrek should have been playing in the background tonight. As
      my daughter likes to put it, there i was minding my own business. I wanted to update the CSS with
      additional link behaviors. I made a change to the CSS file and something was off. No problem. I will just
      restore things back to a point when it was all good. Thats when things went sideways. I was able to restore
      the code. However when I tried sync the changes... <span style="color: red;">Error!</span> Red, glowing, angry
      letters on the screen. I tried again and again. I combed google and followed multiple
      threads on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank" </a>Stackoverflow</a> frantically trying to find
      the answer.
      Finally I came across a suggestion the worked. Though very uncomfortable and stressful. The experience
      gave me a better understanding of the platform and the commands that are common when using or debugging. I am
      still happy it over and the day can finally
      end with no loose ends.

      Today I slept in for the first time in a long time. I suppose judging from the time I actually got
      to bed it was not much "extra" sleep. More like a normal amount for me. I decided to take a chunk out of
      my CSS module and get some practice in. I got to the final stretch when I came across a project.
      the description insisted that you be familiar with CSS and HTML tables. In particular forms. it featured a link to
      the
      lesson on forms in the event I wanted to review. I thought to myself "I don't particularly remember going through
      tables at all..?"
      I decided to jump over there and take a look at the lesson. I realized I missed/skipped that lesson. It was
      towards the
      beginning when I had a bit of a cocky attitude towards topics I was familiar with. I had since gone back and
      completed
      the exercises I skimmed over. This one I apparently missed. I am glad I found it sooner rather than later. The
      exercise was simple enough. It required you to make a cheat sheet
      in HTML one or more from a list of choices. I chose to make sheets for <a href="./table.html"
        target="_blank">Tables</a>,
      and <a href="./input_element.html" target="_blank">The Input Element</a> in forms. This is a later entry as i will
      do going forward. Here is a new sheet for <a href="./flexbox.html"
        target="_blank">The_Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox</a>I got some practice in writing and structuring tables.
      from doing them I got a chance to shovel some dirt on the holes in my knowledge concerning tables. If the tables
      load on a mobile device and dont't resize properly then I have not finished the
      modules on responsiveness with topics such as <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox"
        target="_blank">CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout</a> which will be coming up next week.
      might now have all my ducks in a row but they are slowly moving into position.

      It's been a minute since my last post! I did't realize almost a month has gone by since the first opening. We are
      well underway into 2023 at this point and I am still at the relative front steps of this journey. However I used
      to look at how far I have to go
      and the fear and doubt would well up. however I can now look back and that I have been introduced to a lot so far.
      There are a few things that
      I can definitely see have changed.
      No I not coding like the hackers from movies. (nobody does really) Just like reading and writing a human language
      it takes time and practice. I can report that both
      variables have paid off my investments in them. CSS is <em>deep</em> and <em>broad</em> bro! I am focusing on how
      it works rather than trying to
      learn every little thing right now. I initially projected with time I would be on to Java right now. I have
      cheated and looked ahead only to realize
      I should fall back and let it <em>"do what it do"</em> so to speak. I have a supplemental course I purchased on
      sale at <a href="http://www.udemy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Udemy</a> as the instructor is
      actually as excellent as the reviews suggested I came to find out.
      At the moment we are going over <a href="./css_selectors.html" target="_blank">CSS Selectors</a> and specificity.
      Not a very sexy but essential topic. much of what I am doing now is in a way review. however there is a
      significant difference between complete self study and getting the help and guidance of experienced and
      knowledgeable instructors.
      One of the biggest changes has been my comfort level with various tools. As the comfort level increases my
      willingness to experiment
      and explore increases as I become more confident with my moves. Another big improvement is learning about reliable
      resources like the Mozilla Developer Network or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">MDN</a> These have helped me reference things as I needed them and help me discover
      more. However at the moment of this writing none of
      these resources are available. Why? The internet is down. I have been hearing about it every since it happened.
      One thing I found amazing was how close the kids could detect the network was up as opposed to a continues ping. I
      had one setup when I initially started troubleshooting
      the network. I explained to my daughter that the likelihood the problem was internal was low. The explanation I
      gave her was that the administrator in charge of her network was excellent at his job and normally problems will
      be traced to an external source. Moments later a Rogers utility van parks on the corner.
      some time went by and the van eventually left. Looking at the ping results suggested the network was still heavily
      struggling. I starred at the black screen. Long column of "Request timed out" mocked me from behind the blackness.
      I suddenly heard my daughter exclaim "its back up!" I looked back at my screen and the next few lines scrolled by
      reading: <br>
    <p>"Reply from 8.8.8.8: bytes=32 time=91ms TTL=119"</p>
    <p>"Reply from 8.8.8.8: bytes=32 time=91ms TTL=118"</p>
    <p>"Reply from 8.8.8.8: bytes=32 time=91ms TTL=108"</p>
    <br>
    She must have sensed it or something. It's since been hit and miss. Mostly miss. I continue to tinker in my local
    Dev environment. I did get a chance to finish one project. A very simple one but cool none the less.
    The idea is to create a button that seems to levitate slightly when hovered. I noticed others posting the actual
    snippet from <a href="https://codepen.io" target="_blank">CodePen</a> so naturally I had to learn how then
    incorporate it. I am pretty sure the "hover" effect only happens on a laptop and desktop so it probably won't work
    on the phone.</p>

      Since I last posted I have been introduced to quit a few concepts. As my last post pointed out, CSS is a broad
      topic. So far I have covered:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="./css_selectors.html" target="_blank">CSS Selectors</a></li>
      <li>The Box Model</li>
      <li>Assorted CSS Properties</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The Position Property</li>
        <li>CSS Transitions</li>
        <li>Opacity and the Alpha Channel</li>
        <li></li>
      </ul>
      <li>Responsive CSS and Flexbox</li>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="./flexbox.html" target="_blank">Flexbox Properties</a></li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li>Flexbox</li>
          <li>Media Hooks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        That is not an exhaustive list. I could break down some of those headings into subheadings.
        The point is as much as the number of things I will have to become comfortable over time is huge. I also am
        seeing a list pile up behind me.
        My purpose for starting this blog was to chronicle this journey in the most realistic way possible. The biggest
        purpose of this blog is as a sandbox. However, it is a sandbox chronicling a real and meaningful journey to me.
        I apply what I learn with an eye towards the fact that this is a record in effect of that journey. As such I try
        to apply the things I learn properly and thoroughly. Some of the things I learn I do not necessarily apply them
        right away to this site. I often use the real-life sandbox named                <a href="https://codepen.io"target="_blank">Codepen</a> . The analogy of an animal pen on a farm
        comes to mind. I will link relevant projects inline of posts. However, the collection of items I am currently orhave worked on in the past can be found at my <a href="https://codepen.io/RW2023/collections/public" target="_blank">Codepen Profile</a>. That is where you can find an early version of
        this blog. I will take snapshots of it so I can keep a record of how it looked over time.
